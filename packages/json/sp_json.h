/* JSON serialization, defined in packages/json/sp_json.c -- a carried-C
   spin package (Path B), linked on demand when `require "json"` appears.

   The serializer owns no container types. It walks a boxed value through the
   generic container and symbol reflection hooks installed by the generated TU
   at startup, so it lives in its own translation unit and allocates result
   strings on the shared string heap. It compiles against the stable package
   ABI rather than the compiler internal headers. */
