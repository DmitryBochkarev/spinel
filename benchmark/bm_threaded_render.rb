# A threaded render, sized so the collector is the thing being measured.
#
# Nothing else in benchmark/ exercises the collector under concurrency: the
# suite is single-threaded, so the phases that only exist when workers are
# parked -- the parallel slot sweep, the per-worker string budget, the root
# walk over other workers' fibers -- are never entered by anything the gate
# runs. This is that workload, and its shape is copied from the application
# that raised #4384 rather than invented: a web request that RETURNS its
# markup up a nest of views, holding every fragment it has produced so far
# live while it produces the next one, at concurrency.
#
# Four properties are load-bearing. A change that makes this program faster
# by removing one of them has removed the reason it is here:
#
#   1. NESTING, WITH THE CALLER RETAINING.  page -> room -> message -> body
#      -> span, each level returning a String its caller keeps. The live set
#      at any instant is therefore one partial buffer PER LEVEL per request
#      in flight, not one buffer -- which is what puts a request's whole
#      render on the mark's list rather than just its last few kilobytes.
#   2. THE YIELD.  render_room calls Thread.pass with the page's fragment
#      list, the room's buffer and the message's spans all live. Without it
#      no two requests overlap, and the live set stops growing with the
#      number of threads, which is the axis this program exists to walk.
#   3. FRESHLY ALLOCATED TEXT.  Every string interpolates the request id, so
#      no two requests share one. Rendering from a fixture would pin the live
#      set flat and the concurrency axis would go away with it.
#   4. STRING BYTES OVER OBJECT BYTES.  The retained graph is small objects
#      pointing at large strings. That is the ratio under which the object
#      budget is priced off the smaller of the two quantities a mark walks
#      (#4384), and a program whose object heap dominates cannot ask it.
#
# What it shows. The claim in #4384 is that the mark does not parallelize:
# its per-collection cost RISES as workers are added while the slot sweep
# beside it falls. Reading that off a ladder needs the pacing held still,
# because the adaptive budget scales per worker and a wider budget collects
# less often with more live at each collection -- which moves the mark for a
# reason that is not the mark's. So the aggregate budget is pinned across the
# ladder (the object floor is pool-wide, the string floor per worker, so both
# bases are divided by the worker count):
#
#   SPINEL_GC_OBJ_BUDGET=fixed SPINEL_GC_STR_BUDGET=fixed \
#   SPINEL_GC_THRESHOLD_OBJ_KB=$((65536/W)) SPINEL_GC_THRESHOLD_STR_KB=$((65536/W)) \
#   SPINEL_WORKERS=$W SPINEL_GC_PHASES=1
#
# On the machine this was written on (Apple M-series, 6 performance cores),
# where `root walk` is the roots + fibers + globals fields of the [gcph] mark
# split and `scan` is the trace:
#
#   W    colls   objs/coll   mark/coll   root walk   scan      ns/obj   slot sweep/coll
#   1     37      182,158      2.81 ms    0.000 ms   2.81 ms    15.4       5.89 ms
#   2     38      183,220      3.34 ms    0.000 ms   3.34 ms    18.2       4.24 ms
#   4     37      182,923      3.51 ms    0.000 ms   3.49 ms    19.2       3.14 ms
#   8     38      182,717      3.66 ms    0.000 ms   3.63 ms    20.0       2.95 ms
#   12    36      177,930      3.58 ms    0.000 ms   3.56 ms    20.1       2.39 ms
#
# The first three columns are the control: the pacing and the live graph are
# flat, so neither phase is handed more work. Over that range the slot sweep
# falls to 0.41x -- it is the phase that gets the parked workers, and it
# behaves -- while the mark rises 1.27x. Same signs as the application ladder
# in #4384 (mark 2.04x, slot sweep 0.51x), on a smaller machine.
#
# The root walk is 0.000 ms at every worker count, so on this shape the rise
# is not more stacks to scan: it is entirely in `scan`, at 15.4 -> 20.1 ns per
# object marked over a graph that did not grow. Slicing the fiber list to the
# parked workers would reach the column that is already zero.
#
# Run WITHOUT the pins and the mark still reads as rising, but part of that is
# the budget letting more accumulate between collections rather than the mark
# costing more. Both ladders are worth having; only the pinned one is
# evidence.
#
# THE ANSWER IS DETERMINISTIC. Each thread's work is fixed by its index, so
# the digests below do not depend on how the threads interleave, on how many
# workers run them, or on when a collection lands in the middle of one. A
# collector that drops a live fragment, hands one thread another's buffer, or
# sweeps a string still reachable through a retained Span changes a digest
# rather than only a timing -- which is the point of computing them at all.
