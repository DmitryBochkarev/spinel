# Byref eligibility used to require the method name to be unique in the whole
# program. Two things followed, and both are wrong:
#
#   1. Adding an UNUSED class with a same-named method took the ABI away from
#      a method that had it, so a callee's appends stopped reaching the
#      caller's buffer -- silently, from a class nothing instantiates (#4390).
#   2. Two methods that agree perfectly about the parameter were both refused,
#      which is the ordinary shape: a view layer with `show` in nine modules.
#
# What a call site needs is that every arm it can reach agrees on the ABI, so
# that is what is required now: the whole name group takes it or none does,
# and a class no one can instantiate is not in the group.
