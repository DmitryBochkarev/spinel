# A receiver-less call is a call on self, and spinel resolves one by looking for
# a Ruby method of self's class. The universal surface is not a Ruby method, so
# every one of those was a NameError -- in EVERY class, not just a reopened
# Object:
#
#   class Foo
#     def label = "x: " + to_s     # undefined local variable or method 'to_s'
#   end
#
# Two passes already gave an implicit self the receiver it means -- one for a
# native class's own surface, one for five Object predicates. The second's list
# was deliberately short and that is what brought it back (#4387), so the names
# come from the universal answer table now (AN_POLY_RAW), which the inference
# already keeps as the single statement of what a receiver answers.
#
# A name the table carries for some OTHER runtime type -- to_i on a plain object
# -- still has to read as CRuby's bare-identifier NameError rather than as a
# method-call NoMethodError, so the redirected node keeps its vcall flag.
