# A byref String parameter that a lifted proc also captures. The capture
# struct holds the parameter's CELL, and for a byref parameter that cell is
# the CALLER's slot -- here the address of a stack local -- not a GC object.
# The capture's scan marked it anyway, so a collection that reached this proc
# read a header off the stack and called through it: SIGSEGV in the mark, with
# the frame naming a view method (#4391, rubys, on a campfire port where 140
# of 144 view methods take the ABI).
#
# Three things have to line up, which is why it took a real server to arrive:
# the `--rbs` seed keeps `io` a String so it stays byref-eligible even though
# it is captured; `items` is untyped, so `each` cannot resolve statically and
# the block is lifted to a real proc rather than inlined; and a collection has
# to run while that proc is live. Under SPINEL_GC_STRESS=1 the last one is
# every allocation, which is what makes this deterministic here.
