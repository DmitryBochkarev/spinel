# A big Rational's #to_s builds the numerator's text and then the
# denominator's, and the second conversion allocates, so the first text has
# to stay live across it. Every turn allocates before it asks, and the test
# prints how many answers came back wrong together with the first wrong one,
# so a swept numerator shows up as a changed answer rather than a passing
# test. The Rational is held in a local the whole time: only #to_s is under
# test here, not the constructor.
